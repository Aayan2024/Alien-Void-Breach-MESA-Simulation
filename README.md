# üß† Void Breach

**Void Breach** is an **agent-based alien invasion simulation** built in **Python** using the [Mesa](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/) framework.  
It models intelligent predator‚Äìprey dynamics between human *Natives* and alien *Voidspawns* on a terrain-based grid world, featuring pathfinding, terrain costs, obstacles, fog of war, and dynamic rift spawning.

## üöÄ Features

### üéØ Intelligent Agent Behavior
- **Voidspawn (Alien) agents** hunt Natives using **A\*** pathfinding.
- **Native agents** dynamically **flee** from Voidspawn using A\* in reverse (minimizing threat distance).
- Planned expansion for **Q-Learning** to evolve adaptive fleeing behavior for Native leaders.

### üåç Dynamic Environment
- **Terrain tiles** with **variable movement costs**, influencing pathfinding difficulty.
- **Obstacles** block movement and create realistic choke points.
- **Rift portals** periodically spawn new Voidspawn, simulating an expanding invasion.
- Optional **fog of war** system where Natives and Voidspawn have limited vision ranges.

## üß† Simulation Logic Overview

| Component | Role |
|------------|------|
| **`Voidspawn`** | Predator agents using A\* to hunt visible Natives intelligently. |
| **`Native`** | Prey agents using A\* to flee from nearby Voidspawn; future versions learn adaptively via Q-Learning. |
| **`Rift`** | Periodically spawns new Voidspawn agents, increasing invasion difficulty. |
| **`Obstacle`** | Blocks movement for both species. |
| **`TerrainTile`** | Adds movement cost variations (e.g., plains, hills, lava, water). |
| **`Fog of War`** | Hides unexplored or unseen tiles for each faction. |
